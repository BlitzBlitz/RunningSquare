# Running Square 
This is a simple game in the user perspective, just try to get the highest score avoiding all the running walls.
On the other hand in the programming perspective I have tryed to use my set of skills in JavaFX. Making use of some of the JavaFX classes,
I have taken advantage of some nice features that JavaFX has.
Also I utilized some thread features that Java has, which make the UI interactive and offer an opportunity for the back-end to proccess.
The goal was to practice my skills gained from learning.
